# DecisionEngine

DecisionEngine is a simulation of high-pressure systems where
thousands of actions happen at the same time.

The goal is simple:
**when everyone wants the same thing, the system must decide — fairly.**

Inspired by ticket booking platforms, flash sales, and trading systems,
this project focuses on correctness, priority, and calm decision-making
under chaos.
